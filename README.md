# Scylla Manager

Mermaid repository provides tools for managing clusters of Scylla servers. It consists of two main components:

- `scylla-manager`, server that manages Scylla clusters,
- `sctool`, CLI interface to the `scylla-manager` server.

## Setting up development environment

* Install Go
* Install Docker and docker-compose
* Run installation script `install_deps.sh`

If using GoLand update import grouping policy:

* Open File -> Settings -> Editor -> Code Style -> Go
* Go to Imports Pane
* Set "Sorting type" to goimports
* Check every checkbox but "Group current project imports"
* Press OK

## Running a development server and sctool

Let's start the test cluster.
Docker compose environment for test cluster is located in the `testing` directory.
The following command will:
 * build the custom Scylla image that is going to be used for every node in the test cluster
 * start the whole cluster
 * compile and starts manager development server 
 * compile manager development client
 * compile manager agent and deploy it to testing containers

```bash
make start-dev-server
```
Test ScyllaDB cluster consist of two data centers (dc1 and dc2) and 6 nodes (3 nodes per dc).
Additionally two utility containers are spawned:
* `Prometheus` metrics node 
* Scylla Manager database node - metadata storage about the clusters.

```
# Check the status of the cluster
make status

Note: Non-system keyspaces don't have the same replication settings, effective ownership information is meaningless

```

Once `scylla-manager` is bootstrapped use `sctool` to add information about the cluster to the manager:

```bash
./sctool cluster add --host=192.168.100.11 --auth-token token --name my-cluster 
```

Then ask `scylla-manager` to give the status of the cluster:

```bash
./sctool status -c my-cluster
```

If everything worked correctly you should see the output similar to [this](https://docs.scylladb.com/operating-scylla/manager/latest/sctool/#example-status).

## Development
To test new features during development, developers might use following commands:
```bash
make dev-server # compiles and run new `scylla-manager` server
make dev-cli    # compiles new version of `sctool`
make dev-agent  # compiles and deploys new version of agent to all cluster nodes
``` 

More Makefile targets are available in `testing` directory.

## Running tests

If test environment is running correctly you can run tests with:

```bash
make test
```

This runs both unit and integration tests.
You can run them separately with:

```bash
make unit-test
# and
make integration-test
```

Project testing heavily depends on integration tests, which are slow.
Tests should run for couple of minutes. All tests should succeed.

## Extending HTTP clients

There are two HTTP APIs that are specified with Swagger format, the API of the Scylla node and the API of the `scylla-manager` itself.

Client implementations are separated into packages:

- `scyllaclient` which contains client for the Scylla API along with Swagger specification file `scylla-api.json` and,
- `mermaidclient` which contains client for the `scylla-manager` API along with Swagger specification file `mermaid-api.json`.

Both clients are generated automatically by shell scripts.
To refresh generated packages from Swagger specification run:

```bash
make generate

# Or for generating specific client package

go generate ./mermaidclient
go generate ./scyllaclient
```

## Sending patches

Develop on dedicated branch rooted at master.
Pull master regularly and rebase your work upon master whenever your dev branch is behind.
You are allowed and required to force push to your branches to keep the history neat and clean.

Document your work in commit messages.
Explain why you made the changes and mention IDs of the affected issues on Github.

Before pushing please run `make check` and `make test` to make sure all tests pass.

When satisfied create a pull request onto master.
All pull requests have to go trough review process before they are merged.
